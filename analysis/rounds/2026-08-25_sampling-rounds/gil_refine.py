"""Ticket G, secondary analysis: split "not running" into "parked in a wait" and "not on a CPU
at all", which the registered W does not distinguish.

[Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]

WRITTEN BEFORE THE LOADED ARM WAS READ -- BUT NOT BEFORE IT FINISHED.  The first version of this
comment said the loaded arm was still being written when this landed, and cited
raw_gil/l/window.txt as proof.  That was wrong, and the command that checked it printed the
refutation in the same line I read past: arm L finished at 11:40:55, this file was saved at
11:41:08, thirteen seconds later.  What is actually true is narrower and is the part that
matters: the refinement was decided from arm i1 alone, and no command read arm l before this file
existed.  The honest evidence is the transcript order, not the mtimes.

This file exists because the IDLE arm -- which the
pre-registration names as the classifier's known-good input -- came back with W = 0.20 instead of
0, and the six offending dumps were a startup thread (`switch-entered-retry` in
kernel_notifier.renotify_until_acknowledged) plus two receivers sitting at grpc/_channel.py:932.
Line 932 is inside `self._call.operate(...)`, a cygrpc call that releases the GIL, so a thread
there is running in C, not queued behind the interpreter.  Neither is a GIL queue, and both would
inflate W under load.  The registration says: if the idle arm's W is not ~0, fix the classifier
BEFORE reading the loaded arm.  That is what this is, and the mtime of this file against
raw_gil/l/window.txt is the evidence of the ordering.

gil_parse.py IS NOT EDITED.  The registered W stays exactly as registered and is still the
primary number; this only adds a second, clearly-labelled reading beside it.  Changing the
instrument after seeing the treatment arm is the move pre-registration exists to prevent, so the
refinement is derived from the control arms alone and both numbers are always printed together.
That protection does not depend on the timing claim above being right -- it depends on where the
justification came from, which is arm i1 and the grpc source, both quoted here.

THE REFINEMENT.  py-spy reports `active` from the OS thread state, independently of `owns_gil`:
  owns_gil=True                -> holds the interpreter
  active=True,  owns_gil=False -> on a CPU with the GIL released, i.e. inside a C extension
  active=False, owns_gil=False -> not on a CPU: either waiting on I/O, or queued for the GIL
Only the third line can be a GIL queue, so W' additionally requires active=False.
