# Ground truth veth counters, in a form that survives a saturated machine.
# Ticket S prerequisite. [Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]
#
# Usage: poll_veth2.sh <out.tsv> <seconds> [interval]
# Output is byte-identical in shape to poll_veth.sh, so analyze.py consumes it unchanged.
#
# WHY A NEW FILE RATHER THAN AN EDIT.  poll_veth.sh is running right now -- 8/27 mainDev's ticket
# P holds it (pid 737004, cell P_B14, a 380 s window).  Editing a script mid-flight is how you
# corrupt someone else's round, and their data must stay comparable to itself.  The old poller
# also stays valid for the rounds that already used it; this is an additional instrument, not a
# replacement.
#
# WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG.  Not the reads -- the PROCESS SPAWNS.  The original opens
# /sys/class/net/<iface>/statistics/{rx,tx}_bytes with a `cat` each, so a 160-interface fabric
# costs ~320 fork+execs per sweep.  On a box with all fourteen cores pegged those spawns queue
# behind the load, and ticket N measured the result directly: sweep gaps of 2.3, 2.8, 24.7, 8.4
# seconds, the 24.7 landing exactly when the flows started.  analyze.py then refused to produce a
# number from half a dataset, correctly.
#
# THE FIX.  /proc/net/dev carries every interface in ONE file, so a sweep is one read and one awk
# -- two processes instead of 321.  Field 1 is "iface:", field 2 is rx_bytes, field 10 is
# tx_bytes; the leading header lines are skipped by requiring the colon.
#
# v2 TIMESTAMP CHANGE (2026-08-27, after the S-1 self-proof).  The first version took its
# timestamp from awk's systime(), which is WHOLE SECONDS.  That made every measured sweep interval
# an integer, so the S-1 run could only ever report gaps of exactly 2 or 3 s -- and its p95 landed
# on 3.000 against a registered "< 3.0 s" threshold.  The registration had claimed quantisation
# could not decide the verdict; it decided it.  The underlying cadence was fine (mean gap 2.107 s,
# 50 gaps of 2 and 6 of 3 = cumulative drift aliasing, not stalling), but the instrument could not
# show it.  So the instrument was fixed rather than the threshold moved: `date +%s.%N` gives ns
# resolution at a cost of one subshell+exec per sweep.  That is 2 process creations instead of 1,
# against the old poller's ~320 -- the property under test survives, and now it is measurable.
#
# WHY NOT nice -n -20.  Negative nice needs CAP_SYS_NICE, and this machine's sudoers grants only
# a fixed list that does not include renice or chrt.  Raising priority is therefore not available
# without asking Adam for a new sudoers entry, and the spawn fix alone is measured below to be
# sufficient.  Recorded so nobody re-derives it.
