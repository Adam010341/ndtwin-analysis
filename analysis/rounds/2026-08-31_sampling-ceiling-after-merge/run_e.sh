# run_e.sh -- the E round's ladder: 2x2 (batching x recompute period) plus the BL-true control.

#     ./run_e.sh plan              # cell list + wall-clock estimate; touches nothing
#     ./run_e.sh gates             # hand off to gates_e.sh (§2 must be green first)
#     ./run_e.sh ladder            # the 2x2, low rate -> high rate
#     ./run_e.sh bltrue            # the fifth control cell, wall-side three rungs only

#
# WHAT IS FROZEN HERE AND WHY IT IS HERE RATHER THAN IN A SHELL.
#   The ladder, the arms, the interleave and the reps are read from round.env, which is committed.
#   memory/put-measurement-commands-in-script-files: a bracket protects a pattern, not a command,
#   and a value typed at a prompt has no provenance.  Every number this round used is recoverable
#   from the commit that ran it.
#
# THE LADDER-TOP DISCIPLINE (§3 E1) IS THE PART THAT IS EASY TO GET BACKWARDS.
#   * The top rung's availability is judged on MP -- the production-side cell, expected highest --
#     never on BL.  Dropping the top rung because BL died there would cut exactly where the
#     effect is.  So there is NO stop condition in this loop that removes a rung.
#   * A cell that reads healthy at the top rung is recorded as RIGHT-CENSORED (">=1/1"), never as
#     "the ceiling is 1/1".  Two censored cells compared to each other are INDISTINGUISHABLE.
#   * No rung is ever added after freezing (§3 (c), C5).  `plan` prints the full list up front so
#     that "we should have gone higher" is a finding, not an edit.
#
# ORDER.  Low sampling rate first (1/1024 -> 1/1).  Sampling gets heavier as the ladder climbs, so
# when it breaks every completed cell is still valid; the reverse order risks the lot.  Within a
# rung the arms are interleaved BL,M,P,MP and repeated REPS times, so drift across the rung is
# shared by all four arms instead of being confounded with one of them.
