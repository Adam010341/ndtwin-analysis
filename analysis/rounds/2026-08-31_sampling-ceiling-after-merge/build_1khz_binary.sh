# build_1khz_binary.sh -- stage the E round's TWO kernel arms.  RUN THIS BEFORE THE WINDOW OPENS.
#
# [Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]
#
# WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE SCRIPT AND NOT A STEP OF run_e.sh.
#   PREREG §4 and the local fabric queue both forbid building inside the measurement window
#   ("窗內全 repo 禁 commit／build／VM"), and this round's readout is a CPU plateau, so a compile
#   during it is a treatment rather than noise.  A build step hidden inside the measurement driver
#   would violate the round's own environment clause the first time it was needed.
#
# WHY THERE HAS TO BE A SECOND BINARY AT ALL  (PREREG 【TBD-1】).
#   There is no flag.  `kFlowPathRecomputeInterval` is
#       include/ndt_core/collection/FlowLinkUsageCollector.hpp:51
#           constexpr auto kFlowPathRecomputeInterval = std::chrono::seconds(1);
#   with a single use site at src/ndt_core/collection/FlowLinkUsageCollector.cpp:2969, and the
#   only getenv anywhere in the kernel's collection tree is NDTWIN_TOPO_FILE.  So 【TBD-1】's
#   "flag vs revert patch" has only one arm that exists: a second binary.  The remaining choice is
#   WHICH second binary, and that is a decision for the reviewer -- see TBD-DRAFT.md D3.  This
#   script implements the recommended option and refuses to pretend it is the only one.
#
# WHY NOT .test_run/binaries/ndtwin_kernel.ab2d7ed1, WHICH IS ALREADY 1 kHz.
#   Its own provenance file records commit=UNKNOWN and dirty_worktree=UNKNOWN.  Its delta from the
#   1 Hz binary beside it is therefore NOT established to be the one line this round wants to
#   vary; it is "everything that changed between two unrecorded trees".  Building both arms here,
#   from one frozen tree, makes the delta exactly one line and says so with a patch hash.
#
# 🔴 THE VALUE IS PROVEN, NOT ASSUMED.
#   Both arms carry the same SYMBOL, so `nm | grep` cannot tell them apart -- it separated the
#   older binaries only because they predate the constant's existence.  What separates these two
#   is a gtest that 2f57ba5 shipped for exactly this purpose:
#       FlowPathRecomputeInterval.IsOneSecondNotOneMillisecond
#   It must PASS on the 1 Hz build and FAIL on the 1 kHz build.  Both directions are required: a
#   check that can only come out one colour is not a check.  A 1 kHz build on which that test
#   passes has not got the patch in it.
#
# Usage:   ./build_1khz_binary.sh [<commit-ish to freeze at, default HEAD>]
#          DRY_RUN=1 ./build_1khz_binary.sh          # print the whole plan, build nothing
