# lib_e.sh -- shared machinery for the E round (PREREG 2026-08-31_sampling-ceiling-after-merge).
#
# [Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]
#
# WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR.  Everything the E round does to the machine goes through one of the
# functions below, for three reasons that the round's own registration names:
#
#   1. PREREG §4 requires the identity of BOTH binaries per cell -- sha256, ldd, readelf -d
#      RUNPATH, identifying strings.  memory/benchmark-must-name-the-binary-it-measured says
#      naming a commit is not enough: which .so actually loads is decided by RUNPATH, not by the
#      environment.  So identity is captured by one function, called at one place, and it records
#      the RUNNING process's /proc/<pid>/exe as well as the file on disk.
#
#   2. PREREG §2 lists gates, and the D round's lesson (§2.3) is that a gate written in a
#      registration and not called in the script is not a gate.  Every gate here is a function,
#      and gates_e.sh calls each one by name so that a grep of the script can be matched against
#      a grep of the registration.
#
#   3. 🔴 THE ABORT CLAUSES ARE CODE, NOT COMMENTS.  `abort` exits.  Nothing in this round
#      lowers a threshold in response to a reading.
#
# DRY RUN -- AND WHY THE ACCEPT PATH IS THE ONE UNDER TEST.
#   DRY_RUN=1 makes every side-effecting command print instead of running, and makes every probe
#   return a synthetic HEALTHY reading, so the whole control flow -- ladder, arm switching, cell
#   archiving, restore -- executes to completion and leaves a transcript.  This is deliberate and
#   it is the harder direction to test: memory/smoke-the-accept-path-not-just-refusals records
#   that a guard's refusal branch can always be exercised live while the branch it protects
#   cannot, so the protected action is what needs the dry run.
#   DRY_FAIL=<tag> forces exactly one probe unhealthy, so the refusal branch is observable too.
#   A harness whose gate can only ever go one colour is the 08-30 mirrored defect; this one is
#   forced in both directions before it is trusted.

# 🔴 A dry run and a real run must never share a transcript.  CLAUDE.md: "跑過" and
# "讀過未執行" are never tabled together -- and a log file that contains both is exactly that,
# with the added hazard that the dry lines are the ones that look tidiest.
#
# 🔴 But this used to read `LOG="${LOG%.log}.dryrun.log"`, appending to whatever LOG it was handed.
# round.env does `export LOG=`, so a child process inherits the PARENT'S ALREADY-SUFFIXED value and
# suffixes it again: the number of layers equals the process nesting depth, which is how F5 produced
# `run_f5.dryrun.selftest.dryrun.log`.  The suffix logic assumed it was given the original name, and
# `export` handed it the previous level's product.  The missing property has a name: f(f(x)) != f(x).
#
# So the suffix is now DERIVED from an immutable base rather than appended to an inherited value,
# and `derive_log` is a pure function -- base in, name out, no globals -- so nesting cannot reach it.

# 🔴 F-24: the abort destroyed the only record of why it aborted.
#
# Leg 1 died at 02:10:58 on `fabric short of 10` -- the symptom the poller can see, not the reason.
# `$LAB topo-start` returns as soon as it has started a tmux session, so everything the topology
# says about its own startup goes to that pane and none of it reaches $LOG.  abort() then ran
# restore_production -> teardown -> the session was gone.  BOTH ACTIONS WERE CORRECT; the ORDER
# was wrong, and the reason that cell failed is now permanently unrecoverable.
#
# 🔴 The obvious fix does not work.  `sudo tmux -L ndtwinlab capture-pane` needs a PASSWORD on this
# machine -- tmux is not in the NOPASSWD list (checked 2026-09-01) -- so it would fail silently in
# exactly the situation it exists for, which is this project's most-repeated defect shape.
# `ndtwin-lab topo-out` reaches the same pane and IS NOPASSWD, so that is what this uses.
#
# 🔑 The size assertion measures the CAPTURE, not the file.  Writing a header and then checking
# that the file is non-empty is a check the header alone passes -- the instrument would be
# certifying its own preamble.  So topo-out lands in a variable, the variable is measured, and an
# empty capture is reported as NOT CAPTURED rather than as nothing-to-report.
#
# 🔑 Called from BOTH abort branches on purpose.  F-24's headline is that the branch which
# preserves evidence was wired to the case that does not need it: a FORCED abort leaves the fabric
# standing, so its evidence was never at risk, while the real abort tore it down.  Capturing in
# both means the forced-abort gates exercise this path -- otherwise it is one more guard whose

# for (sha256, ldd, readelf -d, strings) can be recorded off the COMPILED ARTEFACT and still be
# perfectly correct while the fabric runs something else.  Only /proc/<pid>/exe can refute that.
#
# On this machine the kernel is exec'd as `./bin/ndtwin_kernel` (stack.sh:766) -- a RELATIVE path,
# so the bare-name/PATH variant that bit the bmv2 launcher cannot occur for the kernel.  The
# remaining ways to run the wrong arm are: the cp did not land; a previous cell's process outlived
# `stack.sh down`; or something rebuilt build/bin between the swap and the exec.  All three are

#      The shape test (64 lowercase hex) is what turns "could not read" into a refusal.

#      made it.  So the verdict is EMITTED as `IDENTITY verdict=MATCH|MISMATCH|UNREADABLE`, and

# include/ndt_core/collection/FlowLinkUsageCollector.hpp:51, its single use site is
# src/ndt_core/collection/FlowLinkUsageCollector.cpp:2969, and the only getenv anywhere in the
# kernel's collection tree is NDTWIN_TOPO_FILE.  Switching this axis means switching the file

#
# 🔴 THE SWAP IS VERIFIED BY sha256 AGAINST THE STAGED FILE'S RECORDED HASH, NOT BY SYMBOL.
# The .test_run/binaries provenance files separate M's binary from Q's with

# are built from the same tree and differ only in the constant's VALUE, so the symbol is present
# in both and the count would read 5 == 5 -- a discriminator with no discriminating power, which
# is worse than none because it looks like a check.
# What proves the value is the build step, where a gtest that asserts `== seconds(1)` is run

# #11 -- RESTORE THE PRODUCTION CONFIGURATION, AND BE LOUD IF IT DID NOT LAND.
#
# All six D-round drivers had this (gate_d:103, ladder_ext:121, wall_f:142, run_c:68, h_probe:142,
# ctl_c:71) and NEITHER new registration inherited it.  It is not a precaution: run_c.sh:46 records
# it happening -- "earlier arm of gate_d.sh set it to 16384 and only its own restore put it back"
# -- which is why run_c added an independent truncate==128 assertion.
#
# 🔴 WHY IT MATTERS MORE HERE THAN IT DID IN D.  This round mutates the P4 source AND swaps the
# kernel binary, F-5 swaps binaries between arms, and the fabric queue has the two rounds adjacent.
# A failed restore therefore contaminates the SIBLING ROUND, which cannot see it -- it inherits a
# fabric whose numbers are merely a little odd.
#
# 🔴 AND THE PROTECTION FAILS AT THE MOMENT IT IS NEEDED.  Restore runs last, when the operator
# has stopped watching; "restore failed" printed into a scrolled-past log is not loud.  So this
# does three things instead of printing: it ASSERTS each element landed, it drops a marker file
# that a release must trip over, and it returns non-zero.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The sampling parameters the COMPILED artefact encodes.  bmv2 loads this JSON at exec and never
# reloads it, so these two numbers -- not the .p4 -- are what describes the fabric a later round
# will measure on.  p4c compiles `random(meta.sample_rand, (bit<16>)LO, SAMPLE_RATE - 1)` into a
# single modify_field_rng_uniform primitive whose two hexstr parameters are LO and SAMPLE_RATE-1,
# so both axes this project moves are readable from it and from nothing else:
#   "0 255" = production, 1-in-256          (lo=0, hi=SAMPLE_RATE-1)
#   "0 7"   = an E-round arm left at 1/8    (hi carries the rate)
#   "1 255" = the 09-01/09-02 zero cells    (lo=1 ⇒ the draw can never be 0 ⇒ NOTHING is cloned,
#                                            while every source-level and `ndt status` reading of
#                                            the rate still says 1/256)
# Prints "<lo> <hi>", or UNREADABLE if the primitive is not where p4c puts it -- which must be
# treated as a failure, never as a pass: an assertion that cannot read its subject has not
# checked it.  Same decode as tools/test_workflow/ndt's sample_rate().

# PER-CELL CPU: a fabric-free baseline in the teardown gap, and a gate reading during the cell.
#
# Adam ruled 2026-08-31 that the desktop STAYS UP during the window.  That is a working point, not
# a defect -- but it means the gate's floor is ~0.5 cores of EXCESS over a ~0.84-core baseline, and
# the baseline itself swings ~0.19 cores over seconds.  Two things claw some discrimination back
# at no cost, and both are RECORDED rather than gated:
#
#   1. a fabric-free baseline PER CELL, taken in the gap teardown already creates;
#   2. claude-desktop / claude / gnome-shell CPU as NAMED covariates per cell.  They are our own
#      processes, so the cost is attributable rather than guessed -- without this, "did that cell
#      get worse because someone was using the desktop?" has no answer, and it will be asked.
#
# 🔴 THE TRAP, NAMED SO NOBODY "FIXES" IT BACK.  The per-cell baseline must NOT become the gate's
# baseline.  The gate judges excess over the ROUND-OPEN reference, which is what makes a drifting
# desktop show up as excess.  Re-baselining per cell would make each cell's drift the new normal,
# excess would stay near zero, and the gate would go green forever -- it would ABSORB exactly the
# drift it exists to catch.  So: reference = fixed, round-open, fabric-down.  Per-cell = covariate.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 🔴 C (reviewer, 08-31): the baseline's SOURCE is operator behaviour, so a single reading is a
# point sample of a moving quantity -- the real detection floor is not 0.5 cores, it is 0.5 plus
# that variation.  So the round-open reference is taken >=3 times and its RANGE recorded, and if
# the range approaches the threshold that fact is itself a result to disclose.
