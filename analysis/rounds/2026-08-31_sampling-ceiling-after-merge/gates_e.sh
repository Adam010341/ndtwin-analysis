# gates_e.sh -- PREREG-E §2's pre-conditions, one call per registered check.
#
# [Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]
#
# 🔴 THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO OBEY.  PREREG §2.3: "as many checks as the pre-registration
# names, that many calls in the script".  The D round listed three checks and gate_d.sh called
# two; the review found it by grep.  So every check below is numbered with the §2 item it
# implements, and the run ends by printing the map, so the two greps can be laid side by side
# without reading either file.
#
#   G1  §2.1  the counters read something at batch_size=1
#   G2  §2.2  no silent wipeout: ratio >= 0.95, samples non-zero, lambda same order, distinct > 0
#   G3  §2.3  cell_verdict.py --selftest, CALLED not merely registered
#   G4  §2.4  CPU gate forced RED   (a burner known to eat one core)
#   G5a §2.4  CPU gate forced GREEN (i)  idle fabric        -- proves it CAN be green
#   G5b §2.4  CPU gate forced GREEN (ii) a normal arm's own load -- proves it does not
#             misreport the experiment itself as contamination      [reviewer-review E3b]
#   G6  §2.4  ratio gate forced RED   (tail 20% of samples zeroed)
#   G7  §2.4  ratio gate forced GREEN (an archived 08-25 D-round cell)
#
# 🔑 §2 line 44 says "four forces"; E3b then splits the CPU force-green into two segments, which
# makes five.  This script runs five and labels them; see TBD-DRAFT.md D11.
#
# ANY gate not coming out as forced STOPS THE ROUND.  There is no branch here that lowers a
# threshold, and `abort` exits.

# -- the UDP counter reader, for G1 -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# 🔴 Sets UDP_INDATAGRAMS.  It is deliberately NOT a command substitution: `abort` ends in
# `exit 9`, and inside $( ) that exits the SUBSHELL only -- the caller would carry on with an
# empty value and the gate would compare two blanks.  That is the exact failure shape the rest
# of this file exists to prevent, so the value comes back through a global instead.
#
# THE BUG THIS REPLACES (found live, 2026-08-31, not by the dry run):
#     grep -A1 '^Udp:' /proc/net/snmp | tail -1 | awk '{print $2}'
# /proc/net/snmp has TWO lines starting `Udp:` (header, values) and the line after the values is
# `UdpLite:`.  `UdpLite:` does not match `^Udp:` -- it is dragged in as the -A1 CONTEXT of the
# values line -- so `tail -1` selects it and $2 is the literal string "InDatagrams".
#
# 🔑 `set -u` made that a crash, which was the lucky direction.  Without it both reads coerce to
# 0, the gate FAILs, and G1 prints its own line: "a counter reads zero against a live ten-switch
# fabric.  That is a broken reader, not a quiet fabric."  The CATEGORY is right and the TARGET is
# wrong -- both counters were fine; the pipeline reading them was not.  A gate that fails while
# pointing at the wrong component costs more than one that stays silent.
#
# The numeric assertion is not an extra guard bolted on: reading a non-number IS the failure
# mode, and without the assertion there is no way to demonstrate that this parse was repaired.
# Forced in both directions -- see FORCE_UDP_NONNUMERIC and the G-UDP rows in the summary.
#
# One expression, one quantity: the old code read the same counter two different ways at the two
# call sites, and only one of them carried the (dead, output-less) `awk '/^Udp:/{u=$0} END{}'`
# fragment.  Two spellings of one reading is how the two ends of a bracket stop being comparable.

# -- G1's load generator ------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHY G1 NEEDS ONE AT ALL (found on the first live run, 2026-08-31; PREREG-E v1.2).
#   `datagrams_sent` increments at exactly two places (sflow_emitter.py:368, :390) and BOTH
#   require a sample to exist.  There is no periodic counter-sample path.  G1 read the counter
#   over a 6 s sleep WITHOUT generating any traffic, so at 1/N sampling the expected delta was
#   zero and NO INPUT COULD HAVE MADE THIS GATE GREEN.  Measured: idle 6 s -> 0 datagrams;
#   3000 packets at 1/256 -> 25 datagrams, 25 samples, 0 send errors.
#   🔑 A gate that can only fail has exactly as much discriminating power as one that can only
#   pass, and this one aborts the round when it fails.  Every recorded G1 pass before today was
#   marked `synthetic`: 4 synthetic passes, 0 live passes, 2 live failures.
#   🔑 Its own diagnosis -- "a broken reader, not a quiet fabric" -- ruled out the one
#   explanation that was true.  After this change that sentence finally has its premise: with
#   asserted traffic on the wire, a zero really does mean the reader.
#
# THE PACKET COUNT IS DERIVED, NEVER WRITTEN DOWN.
#   A literal 3000 is right at 1/256 and silently becomes "almost never passes" at 1/1024 -- an
#   INTERMITTENT gate, which is harder to catch than the permanent failure it replaced.  So the
#   rate is read back out of the P4 source that compile_at asserts it wrote, and the count is
#   derived from it.  P(false red) ~ e^-G1_EXPECT_SAMPLES.  The arithmetic and the substituted
#   values are printed, so the transcript shows what was asked for and why.
#
# THE INJECTION ASSERTS ITSELF, ON AN OBSERVABLE THAT IS NOT sFlow.
#   If the send step failed quietly -- wrong namespace, host down, typo -- we would read zero
#   again and G1 would once more point at the reader.  So the switch-side veth's rx_packets is
#   read either side of the load, and a load that did not move it is a LOAD failure, reported as
#   such.  Otherwise this repair becomes the next source of a confident wrong diagnosis.

# G9 #11 IS ONE GATE WHOSE TWO HALVES CANNOT RUN AT THE SAME POINT IN THE ROUND.
#
# The forced-red half runs mid-gates (search "G9 #11 (forced-red half)").  The clean half cannot
# run there, and that is a property of the round, not a bug in the check: by that point G8 has
# left a staged arm's kernel in $KBIN and the P4 source at that arm's rate, so
# assert_restore_landed is CORRECTLY red.  The original code asked for a green the round's own
# state forbade, read the refusal as "the gate is always red", and stopped the round at 22:03.
#
# 🔑 So the clean half runs at the tail of main(), after restore_production -- which is a STRONGER
# green than the original, not a weaker one.  It is not a situation arranged so a gate can pass;
# it is the gate applied to the restore this round actually just performed.
#
# 🔴 The cost of splitting it: on an abort path the tail is never reached, so the red half can run
# and the clean half not.  That must be a RECORDED gap, not a silent pass -- which is what the two
# variables below and g9_coverage_note (EXIT trap, so it reaches abort paths too) exist for.

    # 🔑 The point is not brevity, it is turning step 0 of the force audit ("does this force have a
    # caller?") from an AUDIT into an INVARIANT.  Before: somebody had to periodically grep for
    # forces with no caller -- and today proved nobody does; `exedriftmid` was written, verified by
    # hand in a report, and never called by a gate.  After: adding a force means adding a ROW, and
    # a row runs.  There is no "exists but is never invoked" state left to hide in.
    #
    # 🔑 It also makes the count self-maintaining.  The last hand-written list said "six" and named
    # seven.  A table has as many rows as it has; nobody counts.
