# Tickets Q and M, six arms, ONE fabric generation, mirrored: base Q M M Q base.
#
# WHY MIRRORED (PREREG section 1). All three conditions have mean position 3.5 -- base at 1,6;
# Q at 2,5; M at 3,4 -- so any drift that is approximately LINEAR over the block cancels exactly
# in every pairwise difference, without anyone having to know its size or its mechanism. The
# rotation `A B C A B C` this replaces has mean positions 2.5/3.5/4.5, leaving every comparison
# contaminated by exactly 1xd.
#
# WHY ALL SIX ARMS RUN THE IDENTICAL WORKLOAD. Q's metric wants steady flows and M's wants churn.
# Running each ticket's own workload on its own arms would put the workload back into the
# comparison as a confounder of position. So every arm runs BOTH: 16 steady iperf3 flows for the
# ratio and the loop period, and 144 short churn flows for the path-fill latency. Q's binaries do
# not change churn behaviour and M's do not change the ratio, so each metric is read off all six
# arms with the other four as controls.
#
# WHY THE ARM IS THE UNIT. Reps inside one arm are reads of one arm. Using their spread as the
# error term for a between-arm difference understates it about fivefold -- this project reported a
# "10.9 SE" that was 0.31 once the arm became the unit, and an independent recomputation agreed
# with the wrong number because it started from the same reps.
