"""Render the failover-budget figure: what the 51.75 s is actually made of.

[Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]

Companion to page36_failover-decomposition.png. That figure answers "what makes the outage
longer" (topology size 3.30x on OVS, data plane 3.12x at 128 hosts). This one answers the
question underneath it -- "what is the outage made OF" -- and retires the number the previous
round carried for its largest term.

Every value is read from committed data, not transcribed:

  * the 51.75 s total comes from the same `failover_cells()` the previous figure uses, so the
    two cannot drift. Importing it rather than re-deriving it is the point.
  * the walk terms are parsed out of walk_sweep.txt, the raw output of walk_sweep.sh.
  * the debounce is read out of intelligent_router.py, because it is a constant in live code
    and a figure that hard-codes it would keep asserting 3 s after somebody changes it.
  * the topology-query bound is the slowest endpoint median in ryu_topo_128host.json.
