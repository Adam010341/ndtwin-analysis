# Sweep install_all_pair_paths across model sizes on one constant fabric.
#
# [Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]
#
# The walk is driven by the MODEL, not by the fabric: install_all_pair_paths(self.static_net)
# walks a graph built entirely from the topology JSON, and the only thing it takes from the
# live fabric is self.switches -- ten datapaths, the same in every cell here. So sweeping the
# model while `ovs-topo-start` builds its fixed 128-host NTG fabric holds the noise floor
# constant and varies exactly one thing.
#
# 4 hosts is deliberately NOT in this sweep: `ndt up ovs 4` dispatches to a different fabric
# (ovs-topo-4host), so its cell would change two variables at once. Run it separately and label
# it as a different fabric.
#
# Commands live in a file rather than on the command line because a `pgrep`/`pkill` pattern
# typed at a prompt matches the shell running it -- three times in one day, 2026-08-20.

# Every ndt call needs this, not just `claim`. Without it `foreign_claim` treats your OWN claim
# as somebody else's and `ndt down` refuses -- correctly, by its own rule, but the refusal
# message points at `--force` rather than at the variable, and taking that advice would tear
# down a lab somebody else really was holding. Exported once here so no cell can forget it.
