"""Four figures for the 9/03 deck: ticket Q (the assumed denominator) and ticket M (1 kHz -> 1 Hz).

[Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]

WHY THESE FOUR. The 8/27 deck's eleven figures all predate the evening of 08-27, so neither Q nor
M appears anywhere in it. Both are code changes with a mechanism a reader can follow, which is the
kind of result that loses the most to being presented as a table of numbers.

THE TWO TICKETS ARE AT DIFFERENT STAGES AND THE FIGURES MUST SAY SO. Q has measured arms; M has
none -- its code landed tonight and not one arm has run. So figures 1 and 2 are measurements and
figures 3 and 4 are labelled, on the figure itself, as mechanism and as pre-data arithmetic. A
reader who takes a screenshot of one panel must still be able to tell which kind it is; that is
why the label is inside the axes and not only in the caption.

NO NUMBER IS TYPED BY HAND. Every value is parsed from a committed log or computed from a closed
form. The parses assert their own yield (EXPECT_* below), because a regex that silently matches
nothing would render a confident empty figure -- this project has shipped that failure before.

WHAT FIGURE 2 DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CLAIM. The divisor gate proves the code now divides by the
interval it actually accumulated over. It does not prove the over-report is gone; that needs the
ratio, which is stage 2 and still running. The two are different claims and the figure carries the
distinction rather than leaving it to the speaker.

    """Read a source file, but refuse unless git can hand the same bytes back.

    Two of these figures print "Source: ..., committed" in their footnote. That was a claim,
    not a check, and it was false for both Q panels: drive_Q.log had never been `git add`ed,
    and raw/*.divisor is excluded by .gitignore:60 (`doc/audit/*/raw*/*`). A `git clean -fd`
    would have deleted the evidence behind the headline number while the slide kept asserting
    it was safe. So the caption is now enforced here instead of written by hand: an untracked
    source cannot be plotted at all.

    [Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]
    2026-08-28: this guard and the pre-commit hook added in f1df56e were mutually exclusive,
    and each was right on its own. The hook refuses doc/audit/*/raw*/* on any branch but
    audit-raw; this guard demanded the cited readouts be tracked on the working branch. The Q
    figures could not be rendered from a clean checkout at all, and the remediation text below
    still told the reader to `git add -f`, a path the hook had just closed. 54551bc got the
    deck out by staging without committing, which is a workaround: the bytes were in nobody's
    history, so the very failure this guard exists to prevent was live while the guard passed.

    Resolved by asking what the guard is FOR rather than what it did. Its purpose is that a
    `git clean -fd` must not be able to destroy the evidence behind a plotted number -- that
    the bytes are recoverable from history by someone else. Tracked-on-this-branch was one way
    to satisfy that; committed-on-audit-raw is another, and it is where the raw now lives by
    rule. So either is accepted.

    The audit-raw arm compares CONTENT, not existence: it hashes the file being plotted and
    requires that hash to equal the blob stored at the same path on audit-raw. Existence alone
    would let a locally edited file be plotted while the footnote pointed at a stale copy that
    says something else -- a citation that resolves to the wrong bytes is worse than one that
    fails to resolve, because it renders and looks right.
