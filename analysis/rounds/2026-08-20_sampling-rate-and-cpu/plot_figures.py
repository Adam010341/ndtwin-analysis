"""Render the slide figures for the 2026-08-20 sampling-rate / CPU round.

Same discipline as doc/audit/2026-08-19_p4-sflow-accuracy/plot_figures.py: every number that
appears on a figure is recomputed here from the archived JSONL under raw/, so a figure on a
slide traces to the run that produced it. Nothing is copied out of REPORT.md -- the report is
one of the things being checked, and checking it found two things (see FIGURES.md).

THE 6 SECOND HEAD TRIM IS NOT OPTIONAL. measure.sh starts the two pollers, sleeps 2 s, then
starts iperf3, so the head of every trace has no traffic in it. Those three or four zero
windows are not a small perturbation of the variance statistics, they dominate them: including
them takes the Fano factor from 0.88 to 1.75 at 1/256 and from 1.05 to 4.34 at 1/64, which
inverts the sweep's conclusion -- the dispersion appears to get *worse* as the sampling rate
rises. TRIM is applied by load_twin() and cpu_stats() so no figure can forget it.

Usage:  python plot_figures.py <output-dir>

    WHY THE `mnone` CELL IS NOT ON THIS FIGURE
    ------------------------------------------
    The matrix was built with a sixth pair, `mnone`, meant to be the intercept: run under
    NDTWIN_CLONE_DISABLE=1 so nothing is cloned. It is not an intercept. Its twin trace carries
    480,540,662,784 counter-units over 2,352 non-zero readings and it measures 553.5 samples/s
    -- a replicate of the 1/64 cell, not a zero. Its CPU says the same thing (67.7/60.0 against
    67.9/60.1 at 1/64). Including it changes the slope by 1.1 us/sample, so nothing here turns
    on excluding it; it is excluded because a point labelled "zero" that is not zero is the
    defect this round has now hit three times.

    The real zero is `mzero`, re-run on a COLD fabric with the control verified before
    measuring: 0 non-zero twin readings across 32 edges. Its iperf3 client.json is a stub of
    nulls -- the jq slimming path in measure.sh turns an errored iperf3 into well-formed JSON
    full of nulls and discards the error text -- so its offered load is taken from the
    /proc/net/dev counters instead, which are independent of both iperf3 and the kernel. They
    put 205.9 Mbit/s on s1-eth1, s2-eth3 and s5-eth2 over 293.8 s, the same three hops at the
    same rate as every other cell. The run happened; only its client-side JSON was lost.

def fig_ladder_inherited(fname):
    """The deck's quantisation ladder next to the same ladder from the 28b8b13 fork point.

    The ladder already in the deck makes one claim -- the staircase is a property of 1-in-256
    sampling, not of a data plane -- by putting OVS and P4 side by side. This extends it along
    the other axis: same data plane, same load, same edge, two code generations three months
    apart. If the staircase and its spread are ours, the fork-point panel should look different.

    All three panels are OVS, one fixed-rate 200 Mbit/s UDP flow, edge s1-eth2, and every trace
    is trimmed to the same 294 s so no panel gets more refresh windows than another.

    Honest about what is and is not controlled. Panels 2 and 3 are a clean A/B: one fabric, two
    300 s runs back to back, only the kernel binary swapped. Panel 1 is the run that is in the
    deck, taken 2026-08-18 on a separate fabric instance -- a different day and a different
    bring-up, which is exactly why it is worth showing that it lands in the same place anyway.
    Its quantum differs (1494 B frames against 1446 B), and that is the deck's own point
    restated: the quantum is a property of the flow's framing, measured per run, never assumed.
