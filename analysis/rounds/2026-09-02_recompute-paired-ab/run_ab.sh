# Paired A/B: two kernels one constant apart, measured at zero sampling and at 1/1024.
#
# [Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]
#
# THE QUESTION (Adam, 2026-09-02): not "how much did it save" but "why is that step triggered
# by whether samples exist at all". Baseline + one low rate is enough to separate those.
#
# WHY THIS IS A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT AND 09-01 WAS NOT
# The 09-01 round compared two binaries twelve days apart, so its 46-point difference is "the
# difference between two rounds", not "the effect of this change". These two arms are the same
# tree, same commit, same compiler, same flags, differing in one constant's value -- built
# 2026-08-31 by the E round and, per their SUPPLEMENTARY-provenance.md §9, never run.
#
# ORDER IS PRE-REGISTERED (PREREG.md §4). The arm is the innermost loop so the two arms sit
# adjacent in time and share whatever the machine is doing; three pairs start with 1hz and three
# start with 1khz, so an order effect cannot masquerade as the arm effect.
#
# BOTH CONDITIONS ARE VERIFIED BEFORE MEASURING, NOT AFTER. A "1/1024" cell that silently
# sampled nothing reads as a small number and gets subtracted from the other arm as if it were
# real -- the same failure as a mislabelled zero, except it shrinks the gap and therefore looks
# conservative rather than broken.
