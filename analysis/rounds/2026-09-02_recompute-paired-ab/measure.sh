# One measurement condition: fixed-rate UDP across the fabric while sampling the twin, the
# interface counters and per-process CPU together.
#
# Usage:  measure.sh <label> <seconds> <rate-mbit>
#
# [Co-developed with claude code -- Adam]
#
# The three probes run concurrently and on independent cadences, which is deliberate: the twin
# poll and the CPU poll each have their own cost, and interleaving them into one loop would make
# every twin sample wait on a /proc scan of ~140 processes. Their timestamps are what line them
# up afterwards, not their ordering.
#
# Traffic is UDP, not TCP: a TCP flow's rate is decided by congestion control reacting to the
# fabric, so "offered 200 Mbit/s" would stop being a fixed input the moment anything else
# changed. Ground truth still comes from the interface counters either way -- the offered rate
# is never trusted as the answer -- but a fixed input keeps the three conditions comparable.

# --json emits a per-second intervals[] array -- 300 entries, ~6,700 lines -- that nothing in

# behind it was only salvageable because /proc/net/dev had counted the traffic independently.
